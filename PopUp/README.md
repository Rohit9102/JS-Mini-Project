# Pop Up Message Project ---

## Description ---

This project is a simple pop-up message system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When a user clicks the Submit button, a pop-up appears with a success message. The pop-up can be closed by clicking the OK button.

## Features ---

Stylish pop-up animation

Smooth transition effects for the pop-up

Responsive design for various screen sizes

## How It Works ---

When the user clicks the Submit button, the openPopup() function is triggered.

The function adds a CSS class open-popup to the pop-up element, making it visible.

When the user clicks OK, the closePopup() function removes the open-popup class, hiding the pop-up again.

## Technologies Used ---

HTML: For the structure of the page.

CSS: For styling the pop-up and button animations.

JavaScript: For handling user interactions (opening and closing the pop-up).


## Installation ---

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rohit9102/popup-message.git

Open index.html in a browser.

## Future Improvements ---

Add an overlay background when the pop-up appears.

Improve accessibility for keyboard navigation.

Use local storage to remember form submission.
