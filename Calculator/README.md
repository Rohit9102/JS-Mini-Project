## How the Code Works ---

HTML Structure

The calculator interface consists of a form with input buttons representing numbers, operators, and control buttons.

The display field (<input type="text">) shows user input and results.

CSS Styling

The calculator has a dark theme with a clean and modern layout.

Buttons have a glowing effect for a stylish look.

JavaScript Functionality

Each button has an onclick attribute to update the display value dynamically.

The AC button clears the display.

The DE button removes the last character from the input.

The = button uses eval() to evaluate the expression and display the result.

## Installation ---

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Rohit9102/calculator.git

Open index.html in a browser.

## Possible Improvements ---

Implement a history feature to store previous calculations.

Add keyboard support for input.

Replace eval() with a safer mathematical parser.

Enhance mobile responsiveness.
