# Password Privacy Toggle ---

This project is a simple password input field with a toggle button to show or hide the password using JavaScript.

## Features --- 

Users can toggle password visibility by clicking an eye icon.

The button switches between eye-close.png and eye-open.png.

Uses JavaScript to dynamically change the input type from password to text.

## How It Works ---

The input field is set to type password by default.

Clicking the eye icon changes the input type to text, revealing the password.

Clicking again switches it back to password.

The icon updates dynamically to indicate the current state.
